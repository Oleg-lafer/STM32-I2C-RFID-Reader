RFID Reader using STM32, USB, and I2C

Project Overview

This project implements an RFID reader system using an STM32 microcontroller, an RFID PN532 sensor, and USB communication with a PC terminal. The STM32 acts as an interface between the PC and the RFID sensor, handling commands over USB (CDC Virtual COM Port) and communicating with the sensor using I2C.

Process Flow

1. PC sends a command (READ_RFID) over USB


2. STM32 receives the command and sends a read request to the PN532 RFID sensor over I2C


3. PN532 responds with the RFID tag UID


4. STM32 transmits the UID back to the PC via USB

Hardware Requirements

STM32 Microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103, STM32F4 series)

PN532 RFID Sensor (I2C mode)

USB connection to PC

UART (optional) for debugging



---

Software Requirements

STM32CubeIDE / Keil / PlatformIO for development

STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

FreeRTOS (optional for multitasking)

A terminal program (e.g., PuTTY, RealTerm) to interact with the USB Virtual COM Port

Code Breakdown

1. USB Communication with PC

The PC sends a command via USB, which is handled by:

uint8_t CDC_Receive_FS(uint8_t* Buf, uint32_t *Len) {
    if (strncmp((char*)Buf, "READ_RFID", *Len) == 0) {
        read_rfid();  // Read RFID when command received
    } else {
        CDC_Transmit_FS((uint8_t*)"Unknown command\r\n", 17);
    }
    return USBD_OK;
}

ðŸ“Œ Functionality:

Listens for incoming USB data

If "READ_RFID" is received, it calls read_rfid()



---

2. I2C Communication with PN532

The STM32 communicates with the RFID sensor using I2C:

HAL_StatusTypeDef pn532_send_command(uint8_t *cmd, uint8_t len) {
    return HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit(&hi2c1, I2C_ADDRESS, cmd, len, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
}

HAL_StatusTypeDef pn532_read_data(uint8_t *data, uint8_t len) {
    return HAL_I2C_Master_Receive(&hi2c1, I2C_ADDRESS, data, len, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
}

ðŸ“Œ Functionality:

pn532_send_command(): Sends commands to the RFID sensor

pn532_read_data(): Reads the RFID tag UID from the sensor



---

3. Reading RFID Tags and Sending UID to PC

void read_rfid() {
    uint8_t readCmd[] = {0x02, 0x01};  // Read command for PN532

    if (pn532_send_command(readCmd, sizeof(readCmd)) == HAL_OK) {
        if (pn532_read_data(uid, sizeof(uid)) == HAL_OK) {
            char uidStr[32];
            sprintf(uidStr, "RFID Tag ID: ");
            for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(uid); i++) {
                char temp[4];
                sprintf(temp, "%02X ", uid[i]);
                strcat(uidStr, temp);
            }
            strcat(uidStr, "\r\n");
            CDC_Transmit_FS((uint8_t*)uidStr, strlen(uidStr)); // Send to PC
        } else {
            CDC_Transmit_FS((uint8_t*)"Error reading RFID\r\n", 20);
        }
    } else {
        CDC_Transmit_FS((uint8_t*)"Error sending command\r\n", 23);
    }
}

ðŸ“Œ Functionality:

Sends a command to PN532 to read an RFID tag

Reads the UID from the sensor

Converts it into a hex string and sends it back to the PC via USB

How to Use

1. Connect the STM32 to the PC via USB

The STM32 will be recognized as a Virtual COM Port (USB CDC).


2. Open a Serial Terminal (e.g., PuTTY, RealTerm)

Set the Baud Rate: 115200

Select the correct COM port (check in Device Manager on Windows or ls /dev/tty* on Linux)


3. Send the "READ_RFID" Command

Type "READ_RFID" and press Enter

The STM32 will read the RFID tag UID and send it back


4. View the Output

If an RFID tag is detected, the PC terminal will display:

RFID Tag ID: A3 5F 77 89 10

If an error occurs, an error message will be displayed.
